title: Late Work
comment: >
  **Pro tips for requesting deadline extensions:** First, don’t share that you’ve been busy in other
  classes. That comes off like “School is really important to me, just my other classes are more
  important than this one.” Second, don’t volunteer an excuse. You’re late. That happens. Instead of
  an excuse, share a link to your repository showing what work you *have* done. And then provide a
  reasonable timeframe for when you expect to have the work complete and submitted, and ask your
  instructor if that timeframe is acceptable.

All work must be submitted before the date and time specified in each project description. Weekly
work, including reading discussions, is due by the start of the first class meeting each week.
<strong>The deadlines in this class, including for draft work, are no different from exam dates in
classes that have exams.</strong> I expect you to do your best to treat them accordingly.

If you believe you are in danger of missing a deadline, you must contact me ahead of the deadline so
we can work something out. To receive an extension, you must have some work completed to show at the
time you request an extension. If you have nothing to show, you will not receive an extension. If
the deadline has already passed, you will likewise not receive an extension.
