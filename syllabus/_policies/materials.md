<h3>Required</h3>
- A blank, bound sketchbook of 100 pages or more
- A wide-tipped black marker, like a Sharpie
- An email account that you check daily
- A browser- or cloud-based bookmarking scheme to aid your information management
- A Basecamp account (invite will arrive via email); Basecamp, not Blackboard, will be where we
  coordinate our work and communication during and outside of class.
- A GitHub account (see note about anonymity in the course technology policy below)
- A personal computer, running a Unix-based operating system, such as Linux, BSD, or MacOS. A Linux
  running virtualized on Windows is fine, but Windows itself is not—you will need access to a
  variety of dev tools that are hard to come by on Windows. Your computer should also have the
  following software installed:
  1. A plain-text editor capable of syntax highlighting and configured for UTF-8/Unicode
    character encoding and Unix-style line endings (LF), entabbed with spaces (two spaces per tab)
  1. Firefox Developer Edition (free)
  1. Git (free)
  1. Node.js (free)
  1. Image-editing software (such as the free and open-source GIMP)
  1. As many different browsers as your operating system supports (e.g., Chrome, Opera, Firefox,
    Vivaldi; all free)
- Virtually hosted server space through Linode or another provider (this may be required later in
  the course; there’s no need to purchase before then—it’s just something to budget for to the tune
  of about $10 per month)
