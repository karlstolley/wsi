title: Technology Policy
---

Technology is an essential part of learning and day-to-day living. It is therefore essential to this
class. You are just as responsible for learning to command various technologies as for any other
course content. Difficulty with technology is not an acceptable excuse for being unprepared for
class or late with assignments.

If you are having trouble with technology or any other material covered in this course, it is your
professional responsibility to do research beyond the resources and guidance provided in class and
find supplemental materials that work for you. I also encourage all students to contact me during my
office hours or at another arranged time. I prefer that you contact me via Basecamp Ping or email
well in advance of assignment and project deadlines.
