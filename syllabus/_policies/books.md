  <b>My policy for assigning books:</b> Required books are all required in the edition indicated;
  the total retail price tag for the entire course should be less than $100 (this one is $53 on the
  high end); and each book should be worthy of a place on your bookshelf or electronic device of
  choice long after the class has ended. I want to help you build your professional library while
  also being sensitive to your personal finances.
