  <b>My policy for assigning books:</b> Itâ€™s important to acquire and read the edition indicated for
  each book, and I only assign newer editions when the content warrants it. The total retail price
  tag for the entire course should be less than $100 (this one is $71 on the high end). Each book
  should be worthy of a place on your bookshelf or electronic device of choice long after the class
  has ended. I want to help you build your professional library while also being sensitive to your
  personal finances.
