title: Course Description
---

<b>From the Catalog:</b> In this project-based course, student teams will build an enterprise-grade
website and web infrastructure integrating server-side applications, databases, and client-side rich
internet applications as a solution to a defined business problem.

<b>Extended Description:</b> Students in this class will have the opportunity to conceive of web
applications as more than just standalone, siloed systems. The course treats web applications as
modular components that must integrate with complex infrastructures for computing, communication,
and data exchange across and even outside of an organization. The course emphasizes methods and
approaches for designing and developing robust but loosely coupled systems, always in anticipation
of any one system’s inevitable failure in production. The course’s preferred methods will require
students to create and maintain extensive testing suites and other automated quality-assurance
measures. Finally, students will immerse themselves in some of the core values of the class:
appropriately scoped features, progressive enhancement, granular commits, semantic versioning,
rigorous code reviews, automated builds, continuous integration/continuous deployment, accurate
code-adjacent documentation, and a healthy suspicion and pessimistic view of frameworks, libraries,
and other dependencies in production.
