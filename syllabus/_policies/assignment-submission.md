title: Assignment Submission
comment: >
  **Pro tip on major projects:** Read the assignment description. Often. Re-read it before major
  deadlines; everything you need to do is listed there. Don’t make up your own deliverables and make
  things more complicated than they actually are.

All major projects for this course will be submitted initially in draft form via Basecamp for
instructor and peer feedback.

**If you do not post a draft by the stated deadline for each project, you will receive a zero for
the entire project.**  Because drafts are by their nature imperfect and incomplete, there is no
excuse for not at least posting whatever you have by the deadline. Learn to start early and work as
you have time. You will get feedback from me and from your peers at the draft stage—at
which point you’ll actually have time and opportunity to act on that feedback. Put simply, draft
submission is in many ways more important than the final-project submission. Plan accordingly.

Some project deliverables, such as final versions of projects and critiques of team members, will
be submitted via email. See each major project’s description for exact submission requirements and
instructions.
