title: Academic Integrity
comment: >
  **In-class demos are not to be reproduced for your own projects.** I routinely write code for
  class demonstrations that parallels course projects. You may not copy or reuse that code in your
  own projects. Study it, learn from it, and by all means critique and ask questions about it—but do
  not copy and paste it, even if you intend to modify it. Any code I’ve written that ends up
  replicated in your project, especially things like function and method definitions and other
  blocks of bespoke code, is a violation of the Code of Academic Honesty and will therefore result
  in an automatic zero on the work or project in question.

As with all courses at Illinois Tech, you are expected in this course to uphold [the Code of
Academic Honesty](https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook/fine-print/code-academic-honesty) as
described in [the Illinois Tech Student Handbook](https://web.iit.edu/student-affairs/handbook).

All work you submit for this course must be your own original effort. That includes all code,
scripts, stylesheets, data structures, and visual designs.

Any use of open-source code libraries and media not of your own making, as well as summarizations
and quotations of text, should be clearly cited as legally and ethically warranted and rhetorically
appropriate. Accessing, storing, disseminating, and otherwise making use of data from third-party
sources must conform to the source’s terms of service, licensing, and other applicable legal and
ethical restrictions.

If you are at all uncertain as to whether you are submitting work that in whole or in part may
violate the Code of Academic Honesty, please contact me well before the work is due to discuss it.

The consequences of academic dishonesty are severe. Any student found in violation of the Code of
Academic Honesty will earn a zero on the project in question, and may be subject to expulsion
from this course with a failing grade. I report all incidents of academic dishonesty to the Chair of
the Information Technology and Management Department, who may take additional disciplinary action,
including reporting violations to the Dean of the College of Computing as well as the offices of
Undergraduate or Graduate Academic Affairs.
