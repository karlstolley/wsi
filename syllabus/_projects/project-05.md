This project, required only of ITMD 567 students, will expose you to the academic research going on
in relation web development. Each student will find ten topically related, peer-reviewed articles
from ACM, IEEE, or other respected venues that publish academic research in computing, and then
write and post to Basecamp an annotated bibliography of your chosen articles. Strive to find
articles published within the last five years, and be sure you're making use of the databases
available through Galvin Library.
